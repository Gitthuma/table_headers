Active learning: table headers

Let's have a go at improving this table.

1. First, make a local copy of our dogs-table.html and minimal-table.css files in a new directory on your local machine. The HTML contains the same Dogs example as you saw above.

2. To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the &lt;th&gt; element ('th' stands for 'table header'). This works in exactly the same way as a &lt;td&gt;, except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. Go into your HTML, and change all the &lt;td&gt; elements surrounding the table headers into &lt;th&gt; elements.

3. Save your HTML and load it in a browser, and you should see that the headers now look like headers.
